## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm red (#E63946), evocative of tomato sauce, pizza ovens, and Italian flair. Chosen to create a sense of warmth and appetite.
- Background color: Light desaturated red (#F1D3D5), providing a soft backdrop that doesn't distract from the data.
- Accent color: Analogous orange (#F4A261) to draw attention to key metrics and calls to action, complementing the primary red.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) combines a modern, readable look with a hint of warmth suitable for both headers and body text.
- Custom pizza-themed icons, plus standard icons for business concepts. Each icon should have a distinct but friendly visual character.
- Clean and spacious layout with a focus on readability. Data should be organized in a clear, tabular format, and charts should be simple and easy to understand.
- Subtle transitions and animations when navigating between sections or updating data. Avoid distracting animations.
